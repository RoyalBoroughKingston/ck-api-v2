Hello,

A new service has been created by an organisation admin and requires a Global Administrator to review:

- :SERVICE_NAME
- :ORGANISATION_NAME
- :SERVICE_INTRO

You will need to:

- Check the content entered is acceptable, descriptive, plain English, and doesn't have any typos
- Add taxonomies to the service, based on the content
- Enable the service if it is acceptable

If the service is not ready to go live, please contact the user that made the request to rectify the problems.

The user that made the request was :ORGANISATION_ADMIN_NAME, and you can contact them via :ORGANISATION_ADMIN_EMAIL

To review the service, follow this link: :SERVICE_URL

Many thanks,
The :APP_NAME Team
